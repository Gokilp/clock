# clock
This is a program written in C++ to simulate a clock. It creates a Time class that has two private data members hours and minutes that represent the current time.

The class constructor takes two integer arguments h and m to initialize the hours and minutes respectively. The addminutes() function is used to add one minute to the time and increments the hour if the minute count exceeds 60. The display() function is used to display the current time in the format hours:minutes.

In the main() function, a Time object t1 is created with an initial time of 2 hours and 30 minutes. The addminutes() function is called on t1 to increment the time by one minute, and the display() function is called to display the updated time.

Overall, this code simulates a clock that can be used to keep track of time.
